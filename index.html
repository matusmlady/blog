<div><h2>Vecerny beh</h2></div>
<div class="glowing">Povedal som si, ze si pojdem zabehat. Samozrejme som sa k tomu dostal az o 9 vecer, hoci som na to myslel uz omnoho skor. Uz to bolo 4.-krat co som behal 4 kilometre. Behavam na boso, v ten vecer som dal rekordny cas pod 25 minut, 17 koleciek po trave vo vnutornom okraji 250 metrovej drahy. Po dobehani som sa vychodil, zobral som si veci a zamieril som k vychodu. Brana bola zamknuta. Pred nou som si vsimol policajne auto. Kazdy vecer policajti drahu chodia zamykat. Rozmyslal som co spravim. Nakoniec som sa rozhodol preliezt. Prestrcil som cez branu topanky, prehodil cez plot bundu a ze sa teda idem stverat cez plot - hned pred policajtami. V tom prisla zpoza rohu pani policajtka a vravi: "Pockajte. Otvorim Vam." Potom som jej povedal ze tam beha este jedna pani. Spytala sa ma, ci neviem, kolko tam uz je. Odpovedam, ze dlho.</div>
